To reproduce the results in this jupyter notebook, first download or clone the repository.
Then, unzip the folder called 'datasets'
Make sure you have python installed (I used python 3.9.0)
Then, make sure you have the following libraries:

pandas==1.1.4
numpy==1.22.4
matplotlib==3.3.2
sklearn

You can run the notebook on a jupyter environment. I recommend downloading the jupyter notebook extension on VSCode.
